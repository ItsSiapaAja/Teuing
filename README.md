# Teuing : Fun Programming Language
## Run a Program
You can download the source code and the executable too in the Releases. After download it, run the executable file at bin folder and just write this at the shell (the shell is inside the `bin` folder, just open `Teuing.exe`) : 
```
[1] >> run
[2] >> "yourfilename".teu
```
The file extentions are `.teu`. For the exit command just follow you can write it too like this : 
```
[1] >> exit
[2] >> yes
```
then it will be showing a "Goodbye" text for a second.
## What's New In 0.0.3?
- Global data called `spc` and `ver` (text type)
## "Hello World" Program
For making a Hello World program, you just need a 2 line of code : 
```
new text abc "Hello World";
print text abc;
```
This line `new text abc "Hello World;` is for making a new data with a name "abc" and having a text type, and `print text abc;` is for print a data named "abc" with a text type. Every data is saved in different type, so you can actually having a same data name but the types are must be different.
## Data Type
There are a 3 different data type (and remember, every different data type has its own storage), the data types are `text`, `integer`, and `bool`.
## Data Manipulate
| Keyword | Description                                                     |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|`new`    |Making a new data                                                |
|`+`      |Adding a text/integer                                            |
|`-`      |For decreasing an integer data                                   |
|`*`      |Multiply an integer data                                         |
|`/`      |Divide an integer data                                           |
|`change` |Change a value of data                                           |
|`erase`  |Erase a data                                                     |

Example code :

```
- Concate a string
new text abc "Hello";
print text abc;
+ text abc " World";
print text abc;

- Increase, decrease, multiply and divide a data with another number
new integer abb 10;
print integer abb;

- Increase
+ integer abb 5;
print integer abb;

- Decrease
- integer abb 5;
print integer abb;

- Multiply
* integer abb 5;
print integer abb;

- Divide
/ integer abb 5;
print integer abb;

- Change a value
change text abc "Halo Semua";
print text abc;

- Erase a data
erase text abc;
```
We dont use a normal evaluation.
## Loop
Its not a loop like any language, its just for showing a number in range.
For Example :
```
loop range(10 until 90) in N outSpace;

loop(range(1 until 10)) start;
print text abc;
```
There are a three different output (`out`, `outSpace`, and `outLine`).
## `label` and `goto` Keyword
`label` will record some of line before they read a `goto` keyword.
For Example:
```
new text abc "Hello World";
new integer abc 10;
new text spc " ";

label a1;

print text abc;
+ text abc ", Teuing is fun";
print text abc;

print text spc;
goto a1;
```
remember you can't use a `label` key when the first `label` is in recording process.
## Other Keywords
The other keyword is for outputing something, for example is `print`, `printspace`, and `show`. `print` is used for showing a data value with a new line, `printspace` is same as `print` but it show a space and not a newline (btw, the boolean output is number, not a string), and `show` is for showing all data have been made before.
```
print text abc;
show;
```
## Using a Semicolon!
Dont forget to use a semicolon in end of line;
## There's No Error!
Its for fun, dont be stressed:) (actually i'm too lazy for making an error message).
